## QuaX v4.13.0

What's new in QuaX v4.13.0:
  - Migrated the video player to `better_player_plus`. Previous implementation with `media_kit`, introduced in 4.10.0, lead to several regressions on the video player. It also produced memory corruption issues that often lead to the app crashing and lowered the app's security.

The same way, "Share tweet content" options are not available for articles (text remains selectable). Articles are displayed as a preview when the tweet is not opened. Open the tweet to see the full content. Articles can be saved, but for complexity reasons, only the preview is saved for offline access, network is required to read the full content of a saved article.
